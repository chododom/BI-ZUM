# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

Assignments submitted as part of the BI-ZUM course at FIT CTU in Prague.

1. State space search
    - path finding algorithms and their in-terminal visualization
    - C++
2. Genetic algorithm
    - optimization with a genetic algorithm
    - Java
3. Planning
    - finding optimal storyline in a virtual world to reach a certain goal
    - PDDL
    - STRIPS solver with A*
4. Image recognition
    - use genetic algorithm to find a set of five pixels, which are able to distinguish between 26 images (16 x 16 px)
    - images are black and white and represent letters of the alphabet
    - use of:
        - basic evolution - initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, replacement
        - evolution by catastrophe
        - evolution by deterministic crowding
        - island model evolution
